-tag means version of our project/software
-for every commit we can create different tag/version 
to check list of tag we need to use 'git tag' command

~To add tag follow below steps
1.' git tag -a "version no ex. v1.0" -m "msg" ' command
2.now tag is created we can check with the help of 'git tag' command
3.now this tag is created in local repository we need to push this tag in remote repository because
    we need to push tags separately it will not push with file by 'git push origin main'
4. to push tag we need to use 'git push origin <version no ex. v1.0>'
    now we can see this tag/version on remote repository
5.to see the details of tag we need to use 'git show <version no ex. v1.0>' command

-To delete tag from local repository we need to use 'git tag -d <tag name>'
-To delete tag from remote repository we need to use 'git push origin --delete <tag name>'
